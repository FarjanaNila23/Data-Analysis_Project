# Project Overview
The Superstore Sales Analysis project provides an interactive dashboard and drill-through pages to analyze sales, profit, and revenue trends. The report enables business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), customer segments, product performance, and the impact of discounts on sales and profitability.
